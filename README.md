A piece of code I made myself as a challange.

## NIM -  strategy game
* we start with box of 20 stones
* two players makes a move alternately
* there are just two moves:
  * remove 1 stone
  * remove 2 stones
* the winner is opposite to the player who removed last stone

## Lois Warhol
* a piece of code that creates Warhol patch (it takes a photo, clones it 6 times in one frame, and applies different colour patch to each of them) 
* it still needs to be updated with a possibility to load any photo
